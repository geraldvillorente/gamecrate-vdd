# == Drupal VDD Env: ./env/drupalvdd_env/manifests/init.pp
#
# Advanced users may further customize their Undine environment by declaring
# additional resources, usually provided by Undine's resource types. While any
# configuration specific to a given Drupal site (or multisite instance) belongs
# in ./sites, environment-specific configuration can be specified through a
# very similar means in ./env, keeping the two organized and separate.
#
# The following configuration uses the files in the ../files directory to set 
# the PHP memory_limit to 256M (up from Undine's default of 128M), and the MySQL
# max_allowed_packet to 32M (up from Undine's default of 16M).
#
# To use this as the basis of your configuration, copy the env_example directory
# into ./env, and add the following line to ./manifests/site.pp
#
#   include drupalvdd_env
#
# The next time you run either "vagrant up" (if you haven't run it yet) or
# "vagrant provision" (if you have), your changes will be reflected.
